# [color_bot]: (osx)
A fun little side project I made to work on my Computer Vision skillz and to create something my daughter and I could both play with programming. =]


# [Color bot ]:
> Color bot is only OSX right now; but could easily be adapted for other OS -- I am just being lazy with the text_to_speech() function calling "say" on osx.

> Color bot will start and ask you to FETCH something COLOR -- Show it to your webcam (and if the color matches the preset thresholds) it will detect the object and tell you to FETCH something else for it. 

> Hopefully my robot overlord approves of this program.
